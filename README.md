# epic Malta Code Challenge

## High-level Requirements

Implement a REST Web-Service responsible of maintaining a database of mobile numbers assigned to clients along with some related information. The service should support the following fuctionality:
- Return all mobile numbers from the database
- Return all mobile numbers that match the search criteria
- Add a mobile number to the database
- Change a mobile number plan from prepaid to postpaid or vice versa
- Delete a mobile number from the database
- Assign different owners / users of a service.
The following are the known attributes of a mobile subscriber:

| Key | Type | Mandatory | Description |
| --- | ---- | --------- | ----------- |
|Id | Integer | Y | Unique Entity ID |
| msisdn | String â€“ E164 Format | Y | The mobile number in E164 format, ex. 35699123456 |
| customer_id_owner | Integer | Y | The ID referencing the owner of this mobile number. |
| customer_id_user | Integer | Y | The ID referencing the user of this mobile number. |
| service_type | String - Enum | Y | An enum defining the type of service. Possible values are: MOBILE_PREPAID, MOBILE_POSTPAID |
| service_start_date | Unix Epoch Millis | Y | The time this mobile number was created, encoded in Unix Epoch in Milliseconds |

## API Design Decisions

- An OpenAPI specification has been created for the `/subscriptions` endpoint. 
- It has been assumed that the names of the API fields specified within the table above have been agreed upon previously. 
- Even though the `id` and the `service_start_date` are set as mandatory in the table above, this has been interpreted as the fields being mandatory in the database, not in the POST request. If they are passed in a POST request, then a 400 response is returned.
- In an effort to favor the uniform interface approach, the user can pass in the `id`, `msisdn` and the `service_start_date` in the PUT request however if the values do not match the values stored within the database, a 400 response is returned.
- The [OpenAPI Generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator) was used to generate the controller interface in order to ensure that the specification and the implementation match. 

## Database Decisions
- An H2 in memory database has been used. The data within the database will be deleted upon the application being shut down.
- The `id` field is the primary key and it is auto-generated.
- The `msisdn` field is `unique` in order to protect from concurrent inserts.
- The `id`, `msisdn` and `serviceStartDate` fields can not be updated. They are effectively final.

## Other Assumptions
- The E164 format adapted does not expect a `+` as the first character within the string. Furthermore, it was not assumed that the system will only handle numbers with the local prefix (i.e. 356).


## Running the application
1. Build the application using the `mvn clean install` command.
1. Build the docker image using the `docker build --tag mobilenumbersubscriptionstorage .` command.
1. Run the docker image using the `docker run -p 8080:8080 -d --name --name mobilenumbersubscriptionstorage mobilenumbersubscriptionstorage` command.
    1. You can send API requests using the `http://localhost:8080/subscriptions` URL.
    1. The H2 console can be accessed via the `http://localhost:8080/h2-console` URL. The username is `sa` with no password.
1. You can stop running the application using the `docker stop mobilenumbersubscriptionstorage` command. Once the image is stopped, all data within the H2 database will be wiped out.
1. You can delete the container using the `docker rm mobilenumbersubscriptionstorage` command.
1. You can delete the original image using the `docker rmi mobilenumbersubscriptionstorage` command.

NOTE: It is possible to import the application within an IDE however the application needs to be run first using the `mvn clean install` command. This will generate the required code in the `target` folder. The project might need to be re-indexed.

## Improvements
- The `id` field should not be auto-incremental. Ideally, a random number is used, or better yet, a UUID.
- Adding security (authentication and authorization).
- `null` validation at an API level (rather than at a service layer).
- Component/integration testing, in order to ensure that the different application layers work well with each other.
- The OpenAPI generator code is generated under a `src` folder rather than the `target` folder in order to make importing of the project into an IDE simpler.
- Refactoring the validation logic to make it more obvious what is being validated within the POST and PUT requests.
